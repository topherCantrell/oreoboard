The robot has undergone many hardware changes, but it is now locked away until competition. We'll get one day before competition to prepare the robot. A very, very small part of that time will be mounting the LED strips.

This is the plan:

## Under Glow ##

There is a metal plate beneath the robot. There will be maybe an inch between that and the ground. The idea is to mount LEDs around the perimeter of the plate and have the 'bot glow from beneath.

The LED square on the plate is 11" by 14".

This is made with the medium density strips. two 22-pixel sides and two 16-pixel sides (76 total).

## Gear Basket Front ##

The front of the gear basket has room for the two circle plates (maybe for eyes).

The plate is 11.5" by 4".

Three 8x8 plates or 2 circular plates.

## Perimeter ##

We can run one strip of LEDs around the perimeter of the robot and zip-tie them to the metal. This perimeter will be up high and very visible.

The perimeter is roughly 22" by 14". We'll have to do some bending around edges and angles down the side.

This is made from the low-density adafruit reel.
